Captcha solver by Will Grathwohl. 
This package includes code to solve 2 types of captchas. Type 1 are 6 characters involving uppercase letters. I call these "easy" throughout the code. Type 2 are 6 characters containing lowercase letters and numbers. I call these "hard" throughout the code. Within the "hard" captchas there are two types; one type has the letters clear and tightly together and the other type has the letters blurry and farther apart. The examples can bee seen in the "test_files" folder.

It is worth noting that my dataset for the "hard" captchas was very noisy ~8-9% incorrect labels, so while my best model solves the "hard" captchas with 90% accuracy, nearly all of the mistakes were actually due to incorrect labels. 

Tensorflow is required for this package to run
